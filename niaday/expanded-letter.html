                To the prettiest, funniest, nicest, and coolest girl in the world:
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Happy birthday Daniah, thank you for being in my life, thank you for always being there for me. I love you and want you to know
                how grateful I am for having you, how much I cherish our memories together, and how much you make me feel loved. You always light up the atmosphere with your energy, 
                and you always manage to make everyone feel included and happy, you're the best at comforting, but you're also the best at being sarcastically mean. Your presence is a gift
                to whoever is lucky enough to be in it.
                So this year, I want you to know how much you are loved and appreciated. You deserve all the happiness in the world, and I can't wait to see what amazing things this year holds for you and us.
                I know you dont really enjoy your birthday and I was hoping I could atleast try to make it a little nicer for you :).
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Again, Happy birthday, my love.
                <3
